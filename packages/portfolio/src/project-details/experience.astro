  "Developed complex, deeply nested forms using React Hooks; later migrated to React Hook Form to minimize rerenders, eliminating input lag and significantly **improving performance** on heavily nested fields.",
  "Optimized application performance by implementing lazy loading with React.lazy and code splitting, **reducing initial bundle size by 75%** and significantly improving load times.",
  "Migrated legacy class-based components to modern functional components, improving code maintainability and scalability; refactored shared logic from HOCs into reusable custom hooks.",
  "Migrated legacy codebase from Create React App (CRA - Webpack) to Vite, resulting in significantly faster build times, faster development time with HMR and integrated TypeScript support for improved developer experience.",
  "Collaborated with backend developers to integrate frontend components with RESTful APIs, leveraging Axios and React Query for efficient data fetching, caching, and robust error and loading state management.",
  "Migrated from Redux to Redux Toolkit, reducing boilerplate and streamlining the codebase; transitioned all API calls to RTK Query for efficient data fetching with built-in caching, error handling, and loading state management.",
  "Set up ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and TypeScript to enforce consistent coding standards, improve code quality, and streamline the development workflow",
  "Actively participated in regular code reviews to maintain code quality and promote team-wide knowledge sharing.",
  "Implemented component and end-to-end testing for React applications using Cypress and Playwright to ensure functionality and prevent regressions; achieved 100% test coverage and integrated test suites with GitHub Actions for continuous testing in the CI/CD pipeline",
  "Collaborated with the UX team to define and implement design system tokens, ensuring 100% design-to-development consistency across the application",
  "Integrated monitoring and logging solutions like Sentry to proactively track, debug, and resolve production issues, enhancing application stability and user experience.",
  "Implemented secure JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens, and built session-based login using Redis for scalable and efficient session management.",
  "Developed a full-featured ticketing platform with a React frontend, Node.js backend, and MySQL database, enabling end-to-end ticket management functionality.",
  "Worked with S3 to handle files with Express and Flask",
  "Authored comprehensive Swagger (OpenAPI) documentation to clearly define API contracts and improve developer onboarding and collaboration.",
  "Actively participated in Agile processes—including sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives—to ensure timely and scoped delivery of features",
  "Conducted tech talks on various engineering topics to share knowledge, promote best practices, and foster team learning.",
  "I have addressed security vulnerabilities by auditing the dependencies using npm audit and ensured that all critical issues are resolved, keeping our project secure and up to date.",
  "Build, deployed and maintained npm package, private to the organization.",
  "Implemented dashboards using Highcharts, Agcharts. Making sure they are performant and responsive for different themes.",
  "Used google analytics to keeping track of users and their behavior on the website and different events on the website.",
  "Developed and maintained React applications integrated with Firebase for real-time data synchronization and authentication.",
